# TO DO's:

[dificulty, priority]


## Configs

## Improve algorithm
- Use id() to get unique identifier when using state_dict (helps to reduce memory usage) [easy, high] (Might not be possible because of object lifetimes)

## Improve ability to define custom game
- Find a way for people to import their own maps, and also set specific rules such as: specific initial unit placement locations. [hard, high]

## Implement Ray's features
- Use Ray's destributed training. [easy, low]
- Implement Ray's hyperparameter search [medium/hard, low]

## Continuous training / AlphaZero stuff
- Serparar loops de treino e self-play para classes separadas para poder fazer o ponto seguinte. [medium low]
- Implement continuous training option (probably with no intermidiate testing). [medium, low]

## Tester
- AI vs AI should allow different networks for each player [easy, low]

## SCS Game
- Convert board representation to hexagons [hard, high]

## Graphs
- Use network.parameters() to get wight parameters instead [easy, high]
