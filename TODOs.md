! -> I'm working on it

## Configs

## Improve algorithm
- Add option in MCTS to print search information, such as the pb_c values, average possible actions...[easy, medium]!
- Make possible different training->testing input sizes [hard, medium]

## Improve ability to define custom game
- Find a way for people to import their own maps, and also set specific rules such as: specific initial unit placement locations. [hard, high]

## Implement Ray's features
- Use Ray's destributed training. [easy, low]
- Implement Ray's hyperparameter search [medium/hard, low]

## Continuous training / AlphaZero stuff
- Serparar loops de treino e self-play para classes separadas para poder fazer o ponto seguinte. [medium low]
- Implement continuous training option (probably with no intermidiate testing). [medium, low]

## Tester
- AI vs AI should allow different networks for each player

## SCS Game
